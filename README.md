# Dynamic-Arrays-of-Grades

The grade points (GP) earned for each class are found by multiplying the grade by the number of credits in the course. Earning a B+ in a 4-hour course would earn 3.3 * 4 = 13.2 Grade Points. The Grade Point Average is found by dividing the student's total Grade Points by the total number of credit hours completed.
If a student is enrolled in a course but has not completed it, a dummy flag value of -1 is recorded for the grade. Courses not yet completed are excluded from GPA calculations. If a student has not yet completed any course (e.g. first-semester freshmen), the GPA is -1.0 by definition.
